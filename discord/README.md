Disgord
====

Dis**go**rd is an example/starting point for creating an easy to use and 
extensible Discord bot using the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) 
library.

Currently, this is mostly a place holder project.

Gophers](https://discord.gg/0f1SbxBZjYq9jLBk) chat server.**
